# Todo

- [ ] "Beyond the Event" is still pretty rough, including but not limited to "College Partners" and "WRKR Gathering"
- [x] In "Schedule" there is a date-picker that is going up/down instead of side-to-side. Easy fix.
- [ ] Storing images for offline
- [x] Dates are not formatted properly in the event list and the header.
- [ ] Seating charts and maps will pinch-zoom. Right now the experience is less than delightful :disappointed: , but I know I can fix it
- [ ] I haven't designed anything for Mix or Superstart. They will be themed to the brand, but I haven't started.
- [ ] Make it faster. Right now it still looks to the internet so when you click you can see the "loading". This should be near instant. Gotta work on that.
- [ ] We probably should start talking about SuperStart specific content and what that stuff looks like and how it differs from what we have here.
- [x] I need to make the empty lists (like Mix and Superstart right now) not show up.
- [ ] I need to add an app name/icon for when it is installed on a phone.
